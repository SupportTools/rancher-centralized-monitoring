## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:

### 🚨 For Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@support.tools](mailto:security@support.tools)
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
4. **Resolution Time**: Critical issues will be addressed within 7 days

### 🔒 Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Assessment** - We'll evaluate the severity and impact
3. **Fix Development** - We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure** - We'll work with you on responsible disclosure
5. **Security Advisory** - We'll publish a security advisory if needed

## Security Features

### 🛡️ Built-in Security

- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Scratch-based container with only essential binaries
- **Non-root User**: Runs as unprivileged user (UID 1001)
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Root filesystem is read-only
- **No Shell Access**: No shell or debug tools in production image
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration out of the box

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **API Key Authentication**: Uses Rancher API keys for secure authentication
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication with Rancher API over HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: Full SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Secrets Management**: Supports Kubernetes secrets for credential management

### 📊 Security Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Built-in health and readiness endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Metrics**: Security-relevant metrics exposed via Prometheus endpoint
- **Fail-Safe**: Fails securely when connectivity or authentication issues occur

## Security Scanning

### 🔍 Automated Security Scans

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning:

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **GitLeaks** | Secret detection | Every commit |
| **CodeQL** | Static analysis (SAST) | Every commit |
| **Gosec** | Go security analyzer | Every commit |
| **Trivy** | Vulnerability scanning | Every build |
| **Grype** | Container image scanning | Every build |
| **Checkov** | Infrastructure as Code | Every commit |

### 📋 Scan Coverage

- ✅ Source code security analysis
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning  
- ✅ Container image vulnerabilities
- ✅ Dockerfile security best practices
- ✅ Kubernetes manifest security
- ✅ Helm chart security
- ✅ Secret detection in code/config
- ✅ License compliance

## Security Configuration

### 🔧 Deployment Security

#### Kubernetes Security Context

```yaml
# Recommended security context
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  runAsGroup: 1001

podSecurityContext:
  fsGroup: 1001
  runAsGroup: 1001
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
```

#### Network Security

```yaml
# Recommended network policies
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: rancher-monitoring-relay
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: rancher-monitoring-relay
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to: []  # Allow all egress (required for Rancher API)
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443  # HTTPS to Rancher
  ingress:
  - from: []  # Restrict as needed
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9000  # Metrics endpoint
```

#### Resource Limits

```yaml
# Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
    ephemeral-storage: 100Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
    ephemeral-storage: 50Mi
```

### 🔑 Secrets Management

#### Production Secrets

```yaml
# Use Kubernetes secrets (not inline values)
rancher:
  auth:
    existingSecret: "rancher-api-credentials"
    accessKeySecretKey: "access-key"
    secretKeySecretKey: "secret-key"
```

#### Secret Rotation

- Rotate Rancher API keys every 90 days
- Use automated secret rotation where possible
- Monitor for expired or compromised credentials

## Security Best Practices

### 🚀 Deployment

1. **Use Latest Version**: Always deploy the latest stable version
2. **Enable Security Context**: Use recommended security contexts
3. **Network Policies**: Implement least-privilege network access
4. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits
5. **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets, not inline values
6. **TLS/SSL**: Ensure HTTPS communication to Rancher
7. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting

### 🔧 Configuration

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Use least-privilege Rancher API keys
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API keys regularly
3. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging
4. **Health Checks**: Monitor health endpoints
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies and base images updated

### 🏗️ Development

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
2. **Static Analysis**: Use static code analysis tools
3. **Secret Detection**: Prevent secrets in code/config
4. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in CI/CD
5. **Code Review**: Require security-focused code reviews
