# Trivy ignore file for vulnerability scanning
# This file allows you to suppress specific vulnerabilities

# Ignore vulnerabilities in test files and example configurations
# Format: CVE-ID or Package-Name

# Example: Ignore specific CVEs that are not applicable
# CVE-2021-12345

# Ignore vulnerabilities in build tools (not runtime dependencies)
# golang.org/x/tools

# Ignore low-severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
# Example patterns (remove # to activate):
# CVE-2023-*:LOW
# CVE-2023-*:MEDIUM (only if justified)

# Ignore vulnerabilities in base image layers that we can't control
# These should be periodically reviewed and updated
# alpine:*

# Temporary ignores (add expiration dates and reasons)
# CVE-2023-12345 # Expires: 2024-01-01, Reason: Waiting for upstream fix

# Note: Be very careful with ignores in production
# Always document the reason and expiration date
# Review ignored vulnerabilities regularly
